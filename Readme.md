## For Details See [Program Features](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Program-Description#program-features), [Wiki Instructions](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki) and [YouTube Videos](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera#reference-links).
A Unix, Windows, Raspberry Pi Object Speed Camera using python, opencv, video streaming, motion tracking.  Includes a Standalone Web Server Interface, Image Search using opencv template match and a whiptail Admin Menu Interface  Includes picam and webcam Plugins for motion track security camera configuration including rclone sync script.  watch-app allows remotely controller camera configuration from a remote storage service name. Uses sqlite3 and gnuplot for reporting. Recently added openalpr license plate reader support.

## Note re Bullseye: 
Speed-cam.py ver 11.26 and greater will now run under Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye or later with a pi camera module as well as usbcam and IP/RTSP cameras. 
For picamera support Run ***sudo raspi-config***, Interface Options, then enable/disable Legacy Camera option and reboot.

## RPI Quick curl Install or Upgrade   
***IMPORTANT*** - A raspbian **sudo apt-get update** and **sudo apt-get upgrade** will **NOT** be performed as part of   
**speed-install.sh** so it is highly recommended you run these prior to install
to ensure your system is up-to-date.     

#### Step 1
Press GitHub copy icon on right side of code box below.     
or With mouse left button highlight curl command in code box below. Right click mouse in **highlighted** area and select Copy.

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/master/speed-install.sh | bash

#### Step 2
On RPI putty SSH or terminal session right click, select paste then Enter to download and run script.  

This will download and run the **speed-install.sh** script. If running under python3 you will need opencv3 installed if not installed.
If you need to compile openCV see my Github Repo at [menu driven compile opencv3 from source](https://github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup) project

#### Ver 13.00 Notes
Version 13.05 is a major speed camera revision. Camera thread code is now handled by a strmcam.py module.
config.py variable names have changed so you will need to backup and cp config.py.new config.py (see below for details)    
***IMPORTANT*** : All settings are in config.py.  You can delete configcam.py if it exists, once you upgrade to ver 13.05 or greater.
plugins now work.  You can customize plugin files to suit you needs or create your own.  If you are upgrading you should delete, move
old plugins so new ones will be downloaded during UPGRADE.  Please post GitHub issue if you find a bug or problem.  Claude 


***IMPORTANT*** speed-cam.py ver 8.x or greater Requires Updated config.py and plugins.

    cd ~/speed-camera
    cp config.py config.py.bak
    cp config.py.new config.py
    
To replace plugins rename (or delete) plugins folder per below

    cd ~/speed-camera
    mv plugins pluginsold   # renames plugins folder
    rm -r plugins           # deletes plugins folder

Then run ***menubox.sh*** UPGRADE menu pick.

## Mac or Windows Systems
See [Windows 10/11 or Apple Mac Docker Install Quick Start](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera#docker-install-quick-start)    
or [Windows or Unix Distro Installs without Docker](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera#windows-or-non-rpi-unix-installs)

## Program Description   
This is a raspberry pi, Windows, Unix Distro computer openCV object speed camera demo program.
It is written in python and uses openCV to detect and track the x,y coordinates of the 
largest moving object in the camera view above a minimum pixel area.

User variables are stored in the [***config.py***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/blob/master/config.py) file.
Motion detection is restricted between ***MO_CROP_Y_UPPER***, ***MO_CROP_Y_LOWER***, ***MO_CROP_X_LEFT***, ***MO_CROP_X_RIGHT*** variables  (road or area of interest).
***MO_CROP_AUTO_ON*** = ***True*** overrides manual settings and will Auto calculate a rough crop area based on image size.
Motion Tracking is controlled by the ***MO_TRACK_EVENT_COUNT*** variable in config.py.  This sets the number of track events and 
the track length in pixels.  This may need to be tuned for camera view, cpu speed, etc. 
Speed is calculated based on ***CAL_OBJ_PX_*** and ***CAL_OBJ_MM_*** variables for L2R and R2L motion direction. A video stream frame image will be
captured and saved in ***media/images*** dated subfolders (optional) per variable ***IM_SUBDIR_MAX_FILES*** = ***2000*** 
For variable settings details see [config.py file](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/blob/master/config.py). 

If ***LOG_DATA_TO_CSV*** = ***True*** then a ***speed-cam.csv*** file will be created/updated with event data stored in
CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This can be imported into a spreadsheet, database, Etc program for further processing.
Release 8.9 adds a **sqlite3** database to store speed data. Default is ***data/speed_cam.db*** with data in the ***speed*** table.
Database setting can be managed from config.py.  Database is automatically created from config.py settings. For more
details see [How to Manage Sqlite3 Database](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/How-to-Manage-Sqlite3-Database)

or USB Camera plugged in. Make sure hardware is tested and works. Most [RPI models](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) will work OK. 
A quad core RPI will greatly improve performance due to threading. A recent version of 
[Raspbian operating system](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) is Recommended.   
or  
***MS Windows or Unix distro*** computer with a USB Web Camera plugged in and a
[recent version of python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
For Details See [***Wiki details***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Prerequisites-and-Install#windows-or-non-rpi-unix-installs).

It is recommended you upgrade to OpenCV version 3.x.x  For Easy compile of opencv 3.4.2 from source 
See https://github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup

## Windows or Non RPI Unix Installs
For Windows or Unix computer platforms (non RPI or Debian) ensure you have the most
up-to-date python version. For Download and Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) and [Opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)    

The latest python versions includes numpy and recent opencv version that is required to run this code. 
You will also need a USB web cam installed and working. 
To install this program access the GitHub project page at https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera
Select the ***green Clone or download*** button. The files will be cloned or zipped
to a speed-camera folder. You can run the code from python IDLE application (recommended), GUI desktop
or command prompt terminal window. Note bash .sh shell scripts will not work with windows unless 
special support for bash is installed for windows Eg http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/  http://www.cygwin.com/
***Note:*** I have Not tested these.   

## Docker Install Quick Start
speed camera supports a docker installation on    
Apple Macintosh per [System requirements and Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)    
and      
Microsoft Windows 10/11 64 bit with BIOS Virtualization enabled
and [Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 
per [System requirements and Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).   

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your System
1. Clone the GitHub [Speed Camera repository](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera) using green Clone button (top right)
1. Run [docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/) from the directory you cloned the repo into.
1. The Docker container will likely exit because it is using a default config.
1. Edit the configuration file @ `config/config.py`
1. Run [docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/) per documentation
1. Run [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command locally to get a fresh image.
 
## Raspberry pi Manual Install or Upgrade   
From logged in RPI SSH session or console terminal perform the following. Allows you to review install code before running

    cd ~
    wget https://raw.github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/master/speed-install.sh
    more speed-install.sh       # You can review code if you wish
    chmod +x speed-install.sh
    ./speed-install.sh  # runs install script.
    
## Run to view verbose logging 

    cd ~/speed-camera    
    ./speed-cam.py
    
See [***How to Run***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/How-to-Run) speed-cam.py wiki section

***IMPORTANT*** Speed Camera will start in ***CALIBRATE_ON*** = ***True*** Mode.    
Review settings in ***config.py*** file and edit variables with nano as required.
You will need to perform a calibration to set the correct value for config.py ***CAL_OBJ_PX_*** and ***CAL_OBJ_MM_*** for
L2R and R2L directions. The variables are based on the distance from camera to objects being measured for speed.
See [***Calibration Procedure***](https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera/wiki/Calibrate-Camera-for-Distance) for more details.     

The config.py motion tracking variable called ***track_counter*** = can be adjusted for your system and opencv version.
Default is 5 but a quad core RPI3 and latest opencv version eg 3.4.2 can be 10-15 or possibly greater.  This will
require monitoring the verbose log messages in order to fine tune.
    
## Run menubox.sh 

    cd ~/speed-camera
    ./menubox.sh
